                        <h1 class="merienda-dis">THE BIRTH OF CS</h1><br>
                        <p>CS evolved in 2019 when the founders – extremely particular online shopping fanatics – 
                            started to feel that their perusal of e-commerce websites had become so mundane and monotonous,
                            that the spark and associated excitement of shopping online had completely diminished; 
                            to an extent where whenever they visited any other site, it just all looked the same – same products,
                             same experience, same dull feeling.
                            In order to rediscover that lost feeling of euphoria, the founders set about building a 
                            platform of their own that would enable like-minded people to find a plethora of unique and
                             interesting products on one site. At CS, we prefer to be selective about what we choose to
                              feature on our website, rather than just settling for the ordinary. The lengthy selection
                               process enables us to shortlist products which perfectly fit the CS mold.
                            We give credence to the idea of quality over quantity and we would rather have 100 customers 
                            that absolutely love us, than 1,000 that only like us.
                            We are completely committed to finding the right products which enable us to stand out from the crowd.
                             We believe it is this approach that makes the difference between building a brand that is remembered for
                              a lifetime rather than one that is easily forgotten.</p><br><br><br><br>

                         but I'm so glad I did! These shoes exceeded my expectations in every way.
                          The customization options were endless, allowing me to create a pair that
                           truly reflects my personality. The fit is perfect, and the materials used are top-notch.
